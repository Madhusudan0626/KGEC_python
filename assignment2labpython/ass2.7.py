'''The roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, a â‰  0 are given by the following formula:
In this formula, the term b2 - 4ac is called the discriminant. If b2 - 4ac = 0, then the equation 
has two equal roots.
If b2 - 4ac > 0, the equation has two real roots. If b2 - 4ac < 0, the equation has two complex 
roots. 
Write a program that prompts the user to input the value of a (the coefficient of x2),
b (the coefficient of x), and c (the constant term) and outputs the roots of the quadratic equation.'''
